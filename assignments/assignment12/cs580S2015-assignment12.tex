\MYTITLE{Assignment 11\\Proposal Writing Workshop, Part 2\\
\xout{Draft due at the end of class Thursday, 13 February}\\
Draft due Friday, 14 February}
\MYHEADERS{Assignment 11}{Due \xout{Thur., 13 Feb.}Fri., 14 Feb.}

Today we continue the team-editing approach to developing a proposal.

\subsection*{Quick Review of \BibTeX}
The first few minutes of Thursday's class will be given over to a quick review
of \BibTeX.

\subsection*{Discuss/Develop/Review}
For the remainder of the class, continue to work with your partner to add
content to your proposal. You have each received feedback on your 
outline---use the suggestions given there to or try to come up with similar
suggestions based on the same reasoning.

You should particularly concentrate on producing a good 
example, demonstration, or other motivating device. You should also 
try to locate good references on both your topic and the broader
topics that tie in to it (e.g., general references on ``genetic algorithms''
or ``evolutionary computing'').

\xout{At the end of the class} By Friday, hand in as much of your draft 
as you have had time to complete.
