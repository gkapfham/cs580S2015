\MYHEADERS{Introduction to Research in Computer Science}{Due 23 January 2015}

The goal of this assignment is to help you better understand the key characteristics of the discipline of computer
science. To achieve this goal, you should read the paper ``Computing as a Discipline'', by Peter J. Denning et.\ al.\
and write one-page paper review.

To better understand how to read this first paper, you should study the article ``How to Read a Paper'' by S.\ Keshav
and learn more about a three-pass approach to reading research in computer science. Then, you should examine ``Reading a
Computer Science Research Paper'' by Philip W.L.\ Fong and learn how to write a paper review that contains sections
normally called ``summary'', ``critique'', and ``synthesis''.
