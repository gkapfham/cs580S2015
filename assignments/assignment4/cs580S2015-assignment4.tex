\MYTITLE{Assignment 4: In-Class Exercise\\23 January 2014\\Writing Theses}
\MYHEADERS{Writing Good Theses}{}

\subsection*{Thesis}
Today we examine what a thesis looks like and how to write a good one. Unlike a proposal, a thesis is a complete documentation of your \textcolor{blue}{finished} project. Everything you proposed to do should be completed at this point. In a way, thesis is an extension of your proposal, as it should also describe and motivate your research problem, describe scholarly literature surrounding it and propose your model/method for solving the proposed problem. However, thesis should provide a more comprehensive description of the literature and a more detailed explanation of the method you used complete with examples, diagrams, etc., and explanation of why it is appropriate. In addition, it should also include sections describing your experiments (if any) and your results, an involved  analysis of your experimental results, and conclude with a concise summary of the project, its results and contributions and propose possible future extensions for the project.  

In summary, your thesis will be considered ``good'' if it includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\textcolor{blue}{Compelling motivation for your completed project.} What are the research questions? Why is this project important, what does it contribute?
\item
\textcolor{blue}{Comprehensive related work summary, integrating the thesis with the appropriate background.}
You should demonstrate the command and comprehension of the appropriate literature, including the most important publications in the field, recent research results on the subject, as well as modern summaries of the subject found in textbooks. The literature should be well-chosen, and cited and referenced correctly (following the instructions).
\item
\textcolor{blue}{A thorough explanation of the methods used in your project.}
You should demonstrate that the methods are used competently and that they are appropriate for answering the proposed research questions. If any new method or an extension to a method is developed in the thesis, it should be clearly reported (methodological development could be the main focus of the thesis). The methods are described completely, so that another researcher could repeat the study. 
\item 
\textcolor{blue}{A detailed explanation of the experimental set up, experiments that were performed, and the results that were obtained.}
The results of your experiments should provide answers to the proposed research questions, and the results should be reported so that another researcher can evaluate their reliability.
\item
\textcolor{blue}{Discussion and conclusions should reflect the results that were obtained in the study.} In the discussion, you should answer the proposed research questions and consider how the results of your project change or complement what was earlier known about the subject from the literature. In the conclusion, some possibilities for the future extension of this project should be discussed and possible new questions can be suggested. 
\item 
No precise limits on length are given for the thesis as a whole or for its individual parts (e.g. Introduction). Lengths should be appropriate for the research subject and questions under study.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Evaluate Some Past Students' Theses}
Work in groups of three. We have 4 stations with one thesis in each station. 
These are final, bound copies of theses completed by Allegheny College Computer 
Science majors. Your group will start at one station and cover every other station.
 
Evaluate each of the theses on each of the above criteria. You do not need to read the whole thesis, just browse through it. Note any
aspects of the theses that need improvement. Note any aspects that
are particularly well-done. In the second half of the class, the groups will be asked
to report back with answers to the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For each thesis, does the author provide sufficient background
and motivation for the project?
\item
For each thesis, does the author demonstrate proficiency in the area
of the completed project? How is this achieved?
\item
For each thesis, does the author demonstrate familiarity with the
scholarly literature surrounding the completed project? Do the
references seem complete? Are the references primarily to Web sites? To
books? To journals?
\item
For each thesis, are there figures, tables, graphs, diagrams or other
visual aids to help clarify the concepts being discussed? Do the
figures appear to be from outside sources? If so, are the
sources properly acknowledged and are the figures used with permission?
\item
For each thesis, is it clear how the author carried out
the research? Are the methods and experiments (if any) explained completely?
\item 
For each thesis, does the author provide insightful discussions and draw valid conclusions from the results of the experiments and explain overall contributions of the completed project? 
\item
For each thesis, highlight any features that your group found to be
particularly well-done. Highlight any features that need improvement.
Feel free to make general comments concerning theses.
\end{enumerate}
