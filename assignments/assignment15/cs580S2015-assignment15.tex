\MYTITLE{Assignment 15: Research Paper Review\\Due Thursday, 26 February 2015}
\MYHEADERS{Assignment 15}{Due Thursday, 26 February 2015}

\subsection*{General Information}

For Module 3 you will read two research articles and use \LaTeX\ to write a one-page review of them.

\subsection*{Overview of the Papers}

Both of the papers for this module explain how multi-robot systems can be used to solve practical real-world problems
such as perimeter surveillance and landmine detection. Although these papers have direct connections to real-world
situations, they present ideas that are firmly grounded in a mathematical foundation. In addition, both papers present
thorough empirical studies that evaluate the trade-offs associated with each presented method. Notice, in particular,
how both of the chosen papers use different types of graphs to present the experimental results.

\subsection*{The Assignment}

  Each of the assigned papers describes typical research in the area of multi-robot systems. After reading both of these
  papers, you should understand the types of problems that can be solved with multi-robots, better see the big picture
  of the methodology and mathematics used to describe this type of system, and take in the basics concerning how
  results are presented in this field.

  After you have finished reading the papers, use \LaTeX\ to write a one-page summary encompassing them both.  This does
  not require full comprehension of the material presented in the papers --- try to train your eyes to pick up on the
  ``big picture'' without getting lost in the extraneous details of the methodology, implementation of a technique, or
  the empirical results.

  Your summary, devoting about half a page for each paper, should respond to these questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0in
  \item What is the purpose and the background of the research described in the paper? Why is the proposed research
    important and interesting?

  \item What does the related literature suggest about the presented research? How does it further justify the motivation
    behind this research?

  \item In broad terms, what are the methodologies and techniques described in the paper? 

  \item What do the results of the paper show? What are the implications of the results?

  \item Using these papers as a start, what are areas of future research that you could pursue?

\end{itemize}

  As you complete your review, please remember the paper review strategy that we discussed in the first module of the
  course and then practiced during the second module. Please see the course instructor if you have any questions about
  either these papers or this assignment.
