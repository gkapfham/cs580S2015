\MYTITLE{Assignment 29\\Final Project\\
Due Friday, 2 May}
\MYHEADERS{Assignment 29}{Due Fri., 2 May}

As the final assignment for this course, you must complete a project consisting of poster suitable for presentation
during a department-wide poster session, a fifteen to twenty minute in-class presentation that describes your proposed
research, and a ten page final research proposal.

The department-wide poster session will take place on Thursday, 24 April, 2014 during the normally scheduled class
session.  While the course instructors will give you a grade for your poster and your participation in the poster
session, all students in the Department of Computer Science will be invited to provide you with written and oral
feedback about both your proposed work and the poster itself.  By 9 am on the morning of the poster session, please send
a PDF of your poster to the course instructor so that it can be printed at the appropriate size.  Please use all
feedback from the poster session to refine and extend your final project presentation and proposal. Please see the
course instructors if you have any questions about the poster session.

% talk about the final presentations
The final project presentations will take place in class on Friday, 25 April, 2014 and Tuesday, 29 April, 2014. Since
the order of the presentations will be randomly determined and announced incrementally, everyone should be prepared for
their talk at the start of  the first class session. Each student is required to give a presentation about the topic
that they plan to investigate for their senior thesis.  Beyond giving a presentation, each student is responsible for
answering questions posed by both the course instructor and the other students in the course. Please use all of the
feedback from the presentation sessions to improve your final project proposal.

% talk about the final proposal
You should write your final proposal using the same \LaTeX\ templates that you have used for the previous module
proposals. This proposal should describe the topic that you plan to investigate for your senior thesis at Allegheny
College. Students are encouraged, although not required, to reuse content from their module proposals as they prepare
their final proposal. If you do incorporate material from a previous proposal into your final proposal, then please
indicate what content was reused at the end of your document. The submitted version of your final proposal should take
into account the feedback that you received during both the poster session and your final presentation. Please see the
course instructors if you have questions about \mbox{this part of the assignment}.
