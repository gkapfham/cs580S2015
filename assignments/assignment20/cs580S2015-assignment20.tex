\MYTITLE{Assignment 21\\Module 3 Proposal\\
Due Friday, 28 March}
\MYHEADERS{Assignment 21}{Due 28 March}

Write a senior thesis proposal that is related in some way to the topic of
``multi-agent or multi-robot systems''. Your proposal should be a {\em minimum} of 
five pages long, using the \url{senior_thesis_proposal.tex} file in 
the \url{cs580s2014-share/proposal-template} repository on Bitbucket.
You will also need to create a {\tt .bib} file for your references (or
simply modify the file \url{senior_thesis_proposal.bib}).

Choose a descriptive and accurate title for your proposal. Provide a
one-paragraph abstract that summarizes the essential points of your proposal.

You may alter the section headings in the proposal template if a
different organization seems more suited to your topic, but your proposal
should still contain the same information---motivation and background, 
review of previous work in the field, method of approach, evaluation strategy,
schedule, etc. Obviously you do not need to create a complete solution
for the proposed problem, but you need to precisely describe the model you would
use (i.e., how the agents are interacting with each other and the environment) 
and describe how you could potentially solve the proposed problem, 
which method or algorithm would you use and why. 

You have to include at least one {\em technical diagram} or a
{\em flowchart} in your proposal. The flowchart can describe the process
you are using, while the diagram can describe the technical
details of your proposed solution, a model or an algorithm that you
are using. You have to use TikZ (used during the WFCS lab in this module) 
or a similar software to draw your 
diagram in \TeX. You may consult \url{http://www.texample.net/tikz/}
or \url{http://paws.wcu.edu/tsfoguel/tikzpgfmanual.pdf} for more examples
and explanation.

Your proposal should cite multiple scholarly resources for your topic and
related fields---books, journal and conference articles, 
technical reports, etc. The full details about these resources should be 
formatted using \BibTeX\ and should appear 
in the ``References'' section of your paper.

\textcolor{red}{You must have your proposal read and edited by at least one person in this class,
and you must read and edit at least one proposal other than yours. 
Submit the hard copy of the edited version (with hand-written comments by the editor) 
of your proposal signed by both the writer and the editor. 
Also submit a signed hard copy of the final version of your proposal. 
Submit both documents in class on Friday, March 28, and
also commit your final {\tt .tex} and {\tt .bib} files to the your course
repository you have shared with the faculty in a subfolder 
with a name like ``{\tt assignment21}''.}

I'm available in person and via email if you want to run any ideas 
by me, or if you are having problems with your \LaTeX. Ask for help early!
