\MYTITLE{Assignment 8\\Ideas for a Senior Thesis Proposal\\
Part 1 due 6 February 2014\\
Part 2 due 7 February 2014}
\MYHEADERS{Assignment 8}{Due Thu., Fri., 6--7 Jan.}

\subsection*{Part 1: Five Ideas}
Create a short \LaTeX\ document
listing (at least) five possible senior thesis ideas that are related in
some way to the topic of evolutionary computation. For each idea, come up
with a proposed thesis title and a one- or two-sentence 
hypothesis/thesis statement. Hand in a hard copy of this list at the beginning
of Thursday morning's class (you might want to keep a copy for yourself to
refer to during Thursday's discussion).

These do {\em not} have to be ``tightly coupled'' to the subject 
of evolutionary computation. They do {\em not} have to be of the form
``An evolutionary algorithm to solve \ldots.'' However, there should be a
clear connection between your proposed idea and the topic of this module.

It would be ideal if you come up with ideas that are personally of
interest to you, but that is not a requirement. Just try to propose
feasible ideas. Even if you are not interested in carrying out such a project,
perhaps someone else in the class might find your idea worth pursuing.

We will discuss these ideas in class. Be prepared to provide further 
information about your ideas during this discussion.

\subsection*{Part 2: Lightning Talk and Slides}
For Friday afternoon, prepare a ``lightning talk'' (3--5 minutes), together
with several accompanying Beamer slides, in which you expand upon an
idea for a senior thesis related in some way to 
evolutionary computation.

Submit printed copies of your slides at the beginning of Friday's class.
